## :teacher: About this project
The project was created to practice test automation skills using the Selenium (Java) framework, utilizing skills learned in a course on the Udemy platform. The website under test is a website specifically designed for automated testing. The project contains a total of 26 automated tests, created based on test cases defined by the site's developers. After running and executing the tests, using the proper command, a test report can be generated, which describes in detail the activities performed and the statuses of each test.

## :warning: Note:
The tests have been run in Firefox in private mode, which blocks ads. However, it is possible that the test may not work in other browsers due to pop-up ads that require closing.
Tests are not always stable, because sometimes the ads are not blocked completely for some reason.
Additionally, I attempted to utilize Chrome with uBlock Origin, but encountered issues with certain test cases.
